# blog

This is a full-stack blog application that I built from scratch using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It allows multiple users to register an account and create their own blog posts. Anyone can see all of the posts on the blog, but user authentication (with cookies and JWT encryption) is needed when creating, editing, and deleting posts.

Current status: Backend is deployed but deployment of the frontend is still under production due to MongoDB integration with Vercel. Learning about DevOps in the process. For now, here are two of my writing samples that are on my blog and in the MongoDB database cluster:
